### Configurable properties

- **Field label**: Label displayed above the select.
- **Field description**: Description provided below the select.
- **Key**: Binds the selected value to a form variable, see [data binding docs](../configuration/forms-config-data-binding.md).
- **Default value**: Provides a default selection in case no input data exists for the given key. Only available for _static_ options sources.
- **Disabled**: Disables the select, for use during development.
- **Hide if**: [Expression](../../feel/language-guide/feel-expressions-introduction.md) to hide the select.
- **Options source**: Selects can be configured with an options source defining the individual choices the select provides, see [options source docs](../configuration/forms-config-options.md).
- **Validation**: Given that one of the following properties is set, the form will only submit when the respective condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, a validation error will be displayed.
  - **Required**: One select entry must be selected.

### Datatypes

Select components can be bound to `any` data, but we recommend working with `strings`. The component will correlate the data value with the appropriate option defined in the options source. If no option is found, the data will simply be ignored.
